        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During working on the interface between supply chain management and data-driven algorithms, I find a new interesting world. It is different from such fields as my master to PhD time. At then, I worked on (stochastic/nonlinear) partial differential equations and nonlinear dynamic systems. They are too far to be applied. But now, what we work is deployed on real-world supply chain system and you can see the real profits. </p><p>Thus, I start to write blogs. I hope to organize the issues I understand and the meaningful papers/works/results. Meanwhile, I want to exercise the writing. Making people to know my thoughts is another goal. At least, I hope to write for fun and find anyone who is also interested in similar topics.</p>]]></content>
