        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During working on the interface between supply chain management and data-driven algorithms, I find a new interesting world. It is different from such fields as my master to PhD time. At then, I worked on (stochastic/nonlinear) partial differential equations and nonlinear dynamic systems. They are too far to be applied. But now, what we work is deployed on real-world supply chain system and you can see the real profits.</p><p>In my opinion, supply chain management has a wide working field. Within it, I focus on manufacturing planning, capacity planning, scheduling and the optimization problems relative to them. Meanwhile, we also make some works in decision making, risk management, and (beer/stackelberg) game. It is exciting to see how many profits can be obtained by algorithmic approaches and explore how much more can be obtained. </p><p>Thus, I start to write blogs. I hope to organize the issues I understand and the meaningful papers/works/results. Meanwhile, I want to exercise the writing. Making people to know my thoughts is another goal. At least, I hope to write for fun and find anyone who is also interested in similar topics. </p><p><img src="/images/hello_world.png" alt="My favorate movie.
